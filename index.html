<!--drop down hamburger menu toggle-->

<!-- constantly sliding carousel on top of which menu sits on left side.
this is sliding through meliorismus's services - artist management events etc.
on the back-most layer is a fading rainbow of colours that blends into eachother moving towards left.
above that layer is the carousel (with invisible background) of sevices-words.
when you toggle open the drop down menu, it shoots out to the right, pushing the carousel service-words to the right, and the rainbow colours continue unphased in the background. -->


<!--body inside is an aniimation of the logo, inflated, bouncing up and down.
on mouse over, the balloon-logo hits the ground and starts deflating.
then a little comment speech bubble comes up top-right of mouse that says 'come in!' which then links to a video/page of examples of our work.
it's cute.-->


<!--home page is a one-pager. all links from the top menu are scrolled to down the page.-->
